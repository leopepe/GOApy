# TODO

* The Sensor.py module needs add a class formatted sensor
* Action.py must implement __call__ method. It will be used by the Planner to actually execute the action itself and change the environment.
* Pants: use pex to package the project
* World facts must be a shared document or list in which the agent would used as knownledge base to retrieve parameters such as: which vpc id should I use while excuting some commands? Or which instance id should it use to stop the application cluster?

# DONE
* Unit Tests
* Dockerize (Makefile)
* Docs: Sphinx
